# Circadian rhythm analysis {#zeitgebr -}

**TODO the perfect one liner**

---------------------------

![TODO add some figure]("rethomics_files/figure-html/achitecture-1.png")

## Aims {-}
In this practical chapter, we will use a real experiment to learn how to:

* Use `zeitgebr` to compute periodograms
* Use [ggetho](ggetho.html) to draw double plotted actograms
* Average periodograms vs conditions
* Find and compare peaks 

## Prerequisites {-}
* You have read about [behavr tables](behavr.html)
* You are familiar with  [ggetho](ggetho.html), our vidualisation tool
* You have already read the [damr tutorial](damr.html)
* Ensure you have [installed](intro.html#installing-rethomics-packages)
`behavr`, `damr` and `ggetho` packages:


## Background{-}

This tutorial focused on circadian rhythm in *Drosophila*, but can be adapted easily to investicate periodicity in different context.

In the [DAM2 tutorial](damr.html), we have learnt how to load data from a real DAM expriment.
Since we already described it in length, it makes sense to use this experiment as an example for our sleep analysis.
**I will assume that you have already read and understood the [DAM tutorial](damr.html)**.
The last thing we did then was loading data and annotating scoring sleep:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sleepr)
dt <- load_dam2(metadata, FUN = sleepr::sleep_dam_annotation)
dt
```


## Getting the data {-}

Instead of going through the whole `damr` tutorial again, I though I would put the resulting data table online.
Importanlty, for simplicity, **I have just kept replicate 1**.
We just need to download it and load it:


```{r}
library(sleepr)
library(ggetho)

URL <- "https://github.com/rethomics/rethomics.github.io/raw/source/material/sleep_dam.RData"
load(url(URL))
summary(dt)
```

## Data curation {-}
First of all, lets visualise all our sleep data.
It is important to **pay critical attention to this graph** in order to assess if anything has gone wrong:

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height=12}
ggetho(dt, aes(z=asleep)) +
      stat_ld_annotations(height = 1)+
      stat_tile_etho() 
      
```

### Dead animals {-}

Some animals may have died during the experiment, and could be wrongly scored as asleep for very long durations.
`sleepr` has an utility function to remove data from dead animals:

```{r}
# we give our curated data another name so we can see the difference
dt_curated <- curate_dead_animals(dt)
summary(dt_curated)
```
As you can see, we now have `r nrow(dt_curated[meta=T])` individuals vs `r nrow(dt[meta=T])` in the original data.
To see which animals have been removed, we could run something like:

```{r}
setdiff(dt[, id, meta=T],
        dt_curated[, id, meta=T])
```
Indeed, from the tile plot nothing seem to have happened in this channel.
Now let us look at the data after curation:

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height=12}
ggetho(dt_curated, aes(z=asleep)) +
      stat_ld_annotations(ypos = "top")+
      stat_tile_etho() 
```

### Animals that died too early {-}

In addition, we could want to, for instance, **remove animals that did not live say longer than 2 days**.
Of course, you need to have a good reason to exclude some animals, and that depends on your specific experiment (this is just showing you how to do it).
To remove animals that did not live longer that 2 days, we use the power of `behavr` tables:

```{r}
# we make a summary table of all lifespan for each animals
lifespan_dt <- dt_curated[, .(lifespan = max(t)), by=id]
# we filter this table for lifespan>2 and we keep the id
valid_ids <- lifespan_dt[lifespan > days(2), id]
# we apply this filter
dt_curated <- dt_curated[id %in% valid_ids]
summary(dt_curated)
```

### Trimming {-}
Generally, we want to remove point according the experimental time.
For instance, we want to remove the begening as animals are acclimatising to their new environment.
In general, we could simply do:


```{r}
dt_curated <- dt_curated[t %between% c(0, days(2.5))]
summary(dt_curated)
```

Which means we removed data before `t=0` and after `t=days(2.5)`.

## Population plots{-}

Now that we have curated our data, we can start looking at the biology.
First, we make a global population plot:

```{r}
ggetho(dt_curated, aes(y=asleep, colour=sex)) +
      stat_pop_etho() +
      stat_ld_annotations() +
      facet_grid(genotype ~ .)
```

The y axis shows the proportion of time sent sleeping, averaged for each animal within a 30min (default) time window.

Then, we can wrap (average) that over one day. We also polish the y axis label:

```{r}
ggetho(dt_curated, aes(y=asleep, colour=sex), time_wrap = hours(24)) +
      stat_pop_etho() +
      stat_ld_annotations() +
      facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
      scale_y_continuous(name= "Fraction of time sleeping",labels = scales::percent)
```

That gives us a good understanding of what happens at the population level.

## Summarise data per animal{-}

Most likely, we want to summarise sleep amount so that we have **one number per animal**.
For instance, we can compute the overall average proportion of time spent sleeping:

```{r}
summary_dt <- 
  rejoin(dt_curated[,
           .(
             # this is where the computation happens
             sleep_fraction = mean(asleep)
             ),
           ,by=id])
summary_dt
```
With `rejoin`, we have put our summary and metadata together, which is suitable for standars graphics/statictics.
For instance, if we are interested in the effect of sleep and genotype on sleep amount, we can make a faceted boxplot, and also add individual points to show all data.

```{r}
ggplot(summary_dt, aes(x=sex, y=sleep_fraction, fill=sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = NA) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=.5) +
  facet_grid( genotype ~ .) +
  scale_y_continuous(name= "Fraction of time sleeping",labels = scales::percent)
```

## Day sleep☼ -- Night sleep☾{-}

Often, we want to compare amount of sleep during the day vs night as they are different processes.
 
### Adding some phase information {-}
The simplest way to do that is to start by adding some phase information to our data.

* **L phase** (light) should be any point **between ZT0 and ZT12** -- [0,12), [24,36), ...
* **D phase** (dark) should be any point **between ZT12 and ZT24** -- [12,24), [36,48), ...

Numerically, this can be done very simply using a [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) on time. In `R`, modulo is `%%`.
The following line creates a new variable in dt. This variable is:
  
* `"L"`  when the remainder of the division of (the corresponding) `t` by 24h is lower than 12h
* `"D"`  otherwise

```{r}
dt_curated[, phase := ifelse(t %% hours(24) < hours(12), "L", "D")]
```

Since we have this column, we can make an improved summary (pay special attention to the last columns):

```{r}
 
summary_dt <- 
  rejoin(dt_curated[,
           .(
             # this is where the computation happens
             sleep_fraction_all = mean(asleep),
             sleep_fraction_l = mean(asleep[phase == "L"]),
             sleep_fraction_d = mean(asleep[phase == "D"])
             ),
           ,by=id])
summary_dt
```
Now, we have three new variables: `sleep_fraction_all`, `sleep_fraction_l` and `sleep_fraction_d`.
We can just replace the y axis with our variable of interest (e.g. sleep in D phase):

```{r}
ggplot(summary_dt, aes(x=sex, y=sleep_fraction_d, fill=sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = NA) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=.5) +
  facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
  scale_y_continuous(name= "Fraction of time sleeping",labels = scales::percent)
```

If we wanted a plot will all three values, we could ["melt"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-reshape.html) our data,
picking all columns starting with `"sleep_fraction_"` as "measurment variables":

```{r}
summary_dt_melted <- melt(summary_dt, measure.vars = patterns("sleep_fraction_"),
                          variable.name = "phase", value.name = "sleep_fraction")
```

Now, instead of three columns for the three variable, we have two columns, one for the actual value and one to describe the phase (all vs L vs D). 
This makes it convenient to use with ggplot:

```{r}
ggplot(summary_dt_melted, aes(x=phase, y=sleep_fraction, fill=sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = NA) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=.5) +
  facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
  scale_y_continuous(name= "Fraction of time sleeping",labels = scales::percent)
```

## Statistics {-}

Often, you want to go further than representing the data, and compute statistics.
`R` was designed primarilly as statistical progamming language.
As a result, a tremendous variety of simple and elaborate statics are implemented.
This section will not go in the details of what you can do in terms of stats, many authors have already published fantastic ressources on this subject.
Instead, we present a very simple examples of what can be done.
At this stage, what you do depends very much on your question, your knowledge of statistics and how much effort you
want to invest.

### Pairwise Wilcoxon tests {-}

Say we wanted to compute, for **females only**, all pairwise tests between all genotype groups (A vs B, B vs C and C vs A). This could be formulated as:

```{r}
pairwise.wilcox.test(summary_dt[sex=="F", sleep_fraction_all], 
                     summary_dt[sex=="F", genotype])
```
We get a matrix showing us all p-values.
You could do that also within males, as long as we replace `sex == "F"` by `sex == "M"`

### Two way anova {-}

If we are interested in the effect of **sex AND genotype**, as well as **their interaction**,
we can model our response variable with a formula: `sleep_fraction_all ~ sex * genotype`:

```{r}
model <- aov(sleep_fraction_all ~ sex * genotype, summary_dt)
summary(model)
```

This shows a strong affect of sex, genotype and their interaction on sleep amount.
There are several way to follow up.
For instance see this [short tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/two-way-analysis-of-variance-anova/).

## Sleep architecture {-}

Proportion alone is not always a sufficent measure to fully descibe the dynamics of sleep.
One way to go further is to study seep as a series of bouts.

### Bout analysis{-}
The function `bout_analysis()`, in `sleepr` is designed for that.
We would use it like that:

```{r}
bout_dt <- bout_analysis(asleep, dt_curated)
```
The result is a new behavr table, with a few differences compared to the ones we used before:

* Each row in the data describes a bout
* The bout can take the values `asleep=TRUE` or `asleep=FALSE` (sleep bout or wake bout, respectively)
* `t` is the onset of the bout (in seconds)
* `duration` is length of the bout (in seconds)

Note that you can use this function to study bouts of other discrete behaviours.
For now, we are only interested in **sleep bout**, so we filter for `asleep == TRUE`.
We also remove the, now redundant, `asleep` column:

```{r}
bout_dt <- bout_dt[asleep == TRUE, -"asleep"]
```

### Bout length vs time of the day {-}

We can use `ggetho` to show how the average bout length depend of the time of the onset of the bout.

```{r}
ggetho(bout_dt, aes(y=duration / 60, colour="sex"), time_wrap = hours(24)) + 
      stat_pop_etho() + 
      facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
      scale_y_continuous(name= "Bout length (min)")

```

Note that this is a bit noisy as we only have a few animals per conbination of treatment.


### Architecture description {-}

One can count the total number of bouts and average bout duration for each individual like so:

```{r}
bout_dt[,
        .(n_bouts = .N,
          mean_bout_length = mean(duration)),
        by=id]
```
You could apply the approach presented before to compute statistics according the the phase (night vs day bouts).

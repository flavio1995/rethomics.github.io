![A Drosophila Activity Monitor](assets/dam.jpg)

## Background{-}
[Drosophila Activity Monitors](http://www.trikinetics.com/) (DAMs) are a wildely used tool to monitor activity of fruit flies over several days.
I am assuming that, if you are reading this tutorial, you are already familiar with the system, but I will make a few point clear before we start something more hands-on:

* This tutorial is about single beam **DAM2**
* We work with the raw data (the data from each monitor is in one signe file, and all the monitor files are in the same folder)


## Downloading tutorial data{-}

First of all, lets get the data I put together for this tutorial.

What the data is...:

* Experiments

Unzip the data

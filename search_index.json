However, there are still very few tools that allows biologist to read, store, visualise and process data in a modular and consistant pipeline. The rethomics framework is a collection of R packages that work together in order to provide a programatic and efficient environment to analyse behavioural data. Since R is a state of the art software for scientific data visualisation and analysis, rethomics integrates in a its rich ecosystem of high-standard packages already available. This tutorial is intended for experimenters and data analysts and provided a suite of both theoritical explanations and very concrete examples of analysis. 1.1 The Rethomics workflow TODO figure "],

Only once you have done can we continue. 2.2 Installing rethomics packages As of today (“2017-08-23”), rethomics packages are not on CRAN, the official R package archive yet. Therefore, we will install the developmental version. For that, we have to install (once for all) use devtools and load it: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) Ensure you have no error messages. Then, we can install some of the rethomics packages. For instance, to install behavr. install_github(&quot;rethomics/behavr&quot;) In the same way, you could replace behavr by another package. For instance, you could install ggetho with install_github(&quot;rethomics/ggetho&quot;). 2.3 All our packages Here is a list of all the rethomics packages as well as their individual description and status: Package Doc Description Travis.CI Coverage behavr Cannonical Data Structure for Behavioural Data ggetho Visualise High-Throughput Behavioural (i.e. Ethomics) Data damr Read Drosophila Activity Monitor Data scopr Read Ethoscope Data sleepr Analyse actvity and sleep behaviour "]

## Lessons from ggplot{-}
In the previous tutorials, we have used `ggetho` to visualise out behavioural data.
This section will explain further how this package can be used to produce flexible plots and how it integrates with `ggplot2`.

[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) is one of the most popular visualisation tool and an unavoidable `R` package.
It implements the powerful concepts of the ["Grammar of graphics"](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/TheGrammarOfGraphics/GOG.html).
The package `ggetho`, which we discuss here, extends `ggplot` for the specific case of behavioural analysis.
At this stage, you really want to have some familiarity with `ggplot2` so you understand its logic.
You will find a fair numbers of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaxJwC_MP9Q) and [books](http://ggplot2.org/book/) online.


## Some behavioural data{-}

In this section, we will **simulate toy behavioural data**.
For that, we start by making some arbitrary metadata.
Here, we have 40 animals, condition "A" vs "B", and sex, male ("M") or female ("F").

```{r}
library(ggetho)

metadata <- data.table(id=sprintf("toy_experiment|%02d" , 1:40), region_id=1:40,
                   condition=c("A","B"),
                   sex=c("M","M", "F", "F"))
head(metadata)

dt <- toy_activity_data(metadata, seed=107)
```
Now, we have a [behavr](behavr.html) object, `dt`:

```{r}
summary(dt)
```


This data is stored in a [behavr table](behavr.html).
It has a column `moving` that that tells us whether an the animal `id` is moving at a time `t`.

## The `ggetho()` function{-}

`ggetho()` is the core function.
It expresses the **relationship between variables**.
In this respect, it works very much like `ggplot()`, but it also pre-processes the data.

For example if we would like:

* The proportion of time spent **moving, on the y axis**
* Versus **time, on the x axis**

We could write:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving))
pl
```

This generates an **empty plot** this is normal because we have, so far, **no layer**.
We will see some layers very soon!

The role of ggetho is to express a relationship between variables and to **compute a summary**, over a certain time window, of a variable of interest **for each individual**.

Importantly, **you decide which variable you want to plot**.
For instance, you could be interested in things like the number (sum) of beam crosses or the average position.

## Tile plots{-}

### Per individual{-}

One of the most interesting layer is `stat_tile_etho`.
It shows the **variable of interest in the (colour) z axis**.
The y axis is discrete (generally the id), and the x axis is time.
So, if we want to show the proportion of time spent moving over time for each individual (id):


```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=id, z=moving)) + stat_tile_etho()
pl
```

By defaut, each pixel is the **mean** (`summary_FUN = mean`, in `ggetho`), over 30 min (`summary_time_window = mins(30)`, in `ggetho()`).
Also, note that the default is `x=t` and `y=id`, so we could just obtain exactly the same with
`ggetho(dt, aes(z=moving)) + stat_tile_etho()`.


### Sorted individual{-}

Sometimes, we want to sort individuals based on a metavariable (discrete or continuous).
For instance let us compute the overall average fraction of time spent moving,
**add it to the metadata**, to then sort individuals from low to high movers:

First, we add a new metavariable (`mean_moving`):
```{r}
# the average time spent moving per 1000 (rounded)
mean_mov_dt <- dt[, .(mean_moving = round(mean(moving) * 1000)), by=id]
# join curent meta and the summary table
new_meta <- dt[mean_mov_dt, meta=T]
# set new metadata
setmeta(dt, new_meta)
head(dt[meta=T])
```

Now, we can express a new relationship where we show the *interaction* between our custom variable and id, on the y axis:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=interaction(id, mean_moving, sep = " : "), z=moving)) +
              stat_tile_etho()
pl
```

Since we use `" : "` as a separator, we have, on the y axis, names as `<id> : <mean_sleep>`.
You can extend this concept to sort also by *males vs females*:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=interaction(id, mean_moving, sex, sep = " : "), z=moving)) +
              stat_tile_etho()
pl
```

### Group averages{-}

Sometimes, we also want to aggregate individuals per group.
For instance, males **average** vs females **average**:
```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=sex, z=moving)) + stat_tile_etho()
pl
```
In this context, every row is not an individual any more, but a group.
The `method` argument of `stat_tile_etho()` allows you to use other aggregates (median, max, min, ...).


## Population plots{-}
### One population{-}
The problem with representing a variable on a colour axis is that it is not perceptually comparable, and we cannot make error bars.
When the number of groups is not too high, it makes sense to  show **the variable of interest on the y axis**, and then draw lines between consecutive points.
For this, we can use the `stat_pop_etho()` function:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) + stat_pop_etho()
pl
```

By defaut, the local average and error bars are computed from the mean an standard errors (`method = mean_se`).
You can compute other types of error bars e.g. bootstrap (`method = mean_cl_boot`).

### Several populations{-}

Often, we want to compare population with respect to a variable.
There are different way to split populations. We can, for instance, **use a different colour line for different groups**:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving, colour=sex)) + stat_pop_etho()
pl
```


Another way, is to use `ggplot`'s faceting system:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) + stat_pop_etho() +
            facet_grid(sex ~ .)
pl
```

Of course, you can combine both when you have more than one relevant metavariable:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving, colour = sex)) +
              stat_pop_etho() +
              facet_grid( condition ~ .)
pl
```


## Wrapping data{-}
When behaviours are periodic, we sometimes want to average our variable at the same time over consecutive days.
In ggetho, we call that time *wrapping*.
It can be done simply with the `time_wrap` argument.
It will work the same for population or tile plots:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving), time_wrap = hours(24)) + stat_pop_etho()
pl
```

Note that you do not have to wrap over specifically 24h, you could work different periods.

## LD annotations{-}

### Basics{-}
In circadian experiments, we often like to add annotations (black and white boxes) to show Dark and Light phases. We have another layer for that:


```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) + stat_pop_etho() + stat_ld_annotations()
pl
```

### Changing LD colours{-}

Sometimes you want different colours to explains, for instance, that days are "subjective"(grey).

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) + stat_pop_etho() +
              stat_ld_annotations(ld_colours = c("grey", "black"))
pl
```


### LD in the background{-}

To put the annotation in the background, we can invert the order of the layers, set the heigh of the annotation to 1 (100%) and add some transparency (`alpha = 0.3`). We also remove the outline of the boxes:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) +
            stat_ld_annotations(height=1, alpha=0.3, outline = NA) +
            stat_pop_etho()
pl
```

### Phase and period{-}

Sometimes you want to show annotations with different phases and periods.
For instance, here, we shift the LD annotations 1h forward:
```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) +
            stat_ld_annotations(phase = hours(1)) +
            stat_pop_etho()
pl
```

One can also plot over a period different from 24h, say 20h days:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) +
            stat_ld_annotations(period = hours(20)) +
            stat_pop_etho()
pl
```

### Regime change{-}

When, you want to indicate a change in regime, say from LD to DD.
A simple way is to use multiple layers with explicit start and end points:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) +
            # the default annotation layer
            stat_ld_annotations() +
            # on top of it, a second layer that
            # starts at day 2 thoughout day 5,
            # and where L colour is grey
            stat_ld_annotations(x_limits = days(c(2,5)),
                                ld_colours = c("grey", "black" )) +
            stat_pop_etho()
pl
```

## Coordinate and scales{-}

### Plot limits{-}
As `ggetho` creates regular ggplot objects, which we can extend. For instance, we can change the scales.
For instance, put the y scale as a percentage between 0 and 100:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving)) + stat_pop_etho() +
        stat_ld_annotations()
pl <- pl + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1),
                              labels = scales::percent)
pl
```


We can also use the same principle to zoom in a finished plot. E.g. between day one and day two:
```{r}
pl + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(days(1), days(2)))
```


### Time scale units{-}

By default, `ggetho` decides the unit of the time axis according to the range of the data.
Sometime you want to override this behaviour to force time to be in a specific unit (here hours).
Using the plot above, we can add a scale:

```{r}
pl + ggetho::scale_x_hours()
```

`R` actually warns you since you are replacing the scale.
Which is fine (as it is precisely what we wanted)!

### Coordinate systems{-}

Sometimes, it makes sense to use **polar coordinates** to show data around the clock:

```{r}
pl <- ggetho(dt, aes(x=t, y=moving, colour=sex), time_wrap = days(1)) +
          stat_ld_annotations(height=.5,
                              alpha=.2,
                              x_limits = c(0, days(1)),
                              outline = NA) +
          stat_pop_etho(geom = "polygon", fill=NA)

pl + coord_polar()
```

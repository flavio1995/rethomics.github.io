# First Steps {#intro}


## Getting `R`

If you have never used or heard of `R` before, 
I suggest you start by [reading about `R`](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [installing RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
Only once you have done can we continue.

## Installing rethomics packages

As of today ("`r Sys.Date()`"), rethomics packages are not on CRAN, the official R package archive yet.
Therefore, we will install the developmental version.

For that, we have to install (once for all) use `devtools` and load it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```


Ensure you have no error messages.
Then, we can install some of the rethomics packages.
For instance, to install `behavr`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_github("rethomics/behavr")
```

In the same way, you could replace `behavr` by another package. 
For instance, you could install `ggetho` with `install_github("rethomics/ggetho")`.

## All rethomics packages

Below is a list of all the `rethomics` packages as well as their individual pdf documentaion, description and status.


```{r kable, echo=FALSE}
packages <- c("behavr", 
              "ggetho",
              "damr",
              "scopr",
              "sleepr"
              )
titles <- sapply(packages, 
       function(p){
          if(!p %in% rownames(installed.packages()))
            return("Unavailable")
          packageDescription(p, fields="Title")
          }
  )

package_name <- sprintf("[%s](https://github.com/rethomics/%s)", packages, packages)
doc <- sprintf("[![PDF](assets/pdf_icon.png)](https://github.com/rethomics/%s/raw/master/%s.pdf)", packages, packages)
travis_ci <- sprintf("[![%s Travis-CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/rethomics/%s.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rethomics/%s)", packages,packages,packages)

coverage <- sprintf("[![%s Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/rethomics/%s/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/%s/behavr?branch=master)", packages, packages, packages)

# `scopr` [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rethomics/scopr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rethomics/scopr)[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/rethomics/scopr/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/scopr/behavr?branch=master)
library(knitr)
kable(data.frame(
              Package = package_name,
              Doc = doc, 
              Description = titles,
              Travis.CI = travis_ci,
              Coverage = coverage),
      row.names = FALSE)
```

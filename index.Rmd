# Analysis of high-throughput behaviour in `R`

![TODO figure]()


In the last few years the ability to acquire **large amount of behavioural data**
from multiple individual experimental animal has increased.
However, there are still very few tools that allows biologists to **read**, **store**, **visualise** and **process** data 
in a modular and consistant pipeline.

The rethomics framework is a collection of `R` packages that work together in order to provide a **programatic and efficient environment to analyse behavioural data**.
Since `R` is a state of the art software for scientific data visualisation and analysis,
rethomics integrates in a its rich ecosystem of high-standard packages already available.

This tutorial is intended for experimenters and data analysts and provided a suite of 
both **theoritical explanations** and very **concrete examples** of analysis.

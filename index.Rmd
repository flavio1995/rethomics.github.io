# Introduction

### If we share a common data structure,  we can use a commmon set of tools{-}

Rethomics framework unify behaviour analysis:

In the last few years, there has been growing interests in *ethomics* -- that is, the analysis of large behavioural data sets.
Many software and hardware solutions have been proposed to record different behavioural variables
on several model organisms.
Although are many similarities between subsequent analysis and visualisation tool,
each method tends to provide its own output format and, in practice, its own, restricted, analysis software.
This results in a lot of replicated work and prohibits extension and collaboration.

Rethomics attempts to unify analysis of behaviour by providing:

* `behavr` tables -- a  flexible and **universal structure** to handle very large behavioural data sets
* `damr`, `scopr`, ... -- packages to **load data** from [DAMS](http://www.trikinetics.com/), [ethoscopes](gilestrolab.github.io/ethoscope) and others into `behavr` tables
* `ggetho` -- a package, based on `ggplot2`, to produce high quality visualisation of  behavioural data
* `sleepr`, `zeitgebr`, ... -- packages to analyse behavioural data (sleep analysis, circadian rhythm, ...).

This document is a tutorial intended for experimenters as well as data analysts.
It provides a suite of both **conceptual explanations** and very **concrete examples**.

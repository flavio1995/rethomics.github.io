# Introduction

### A framework to analyse high throughput behaviour in R{-}

![TODO figure]()


This document is a tutorial intended for experimenters and data analysts.
It provides a suite of both **theoretical explanations** and very **concrete examples**.


### Background{-}

In the last few years, the ability to acquire **large amount of behavioural data**
from multiple individual experimental animals has dramatically increased.
However, there are still very few tools that allow biologists to **read**, **store**, **visualise** and **process** data 
in a modular and consistent pipeline.

The rethomics framework is a collection of `R` packages that work together in order to provide a **programmatic and efficient environment to analyse behavioural data**.
Since `R` is a state of the art software for scientific data visualisation and analysis,
rethomics integrates into a rich ecosystem of high-standard tools.
